# USA-FLU
This repository contains all the codes used to produce the results of the USA-FLU paper.
  
## Data   
The Data folder contains all the data used in this study.  
  
usa_Flu_J_proxy_Data.rda/usa_Flu_J_proxy_Data.csv are the raw data. data processing for PCMCI+.R file is used to produce the data to be used in state-specific (usaflu_raw.csv) and nation-specific (usaflu_norm.csv) PCMCI+ analyses.   
  
## Analyses  
  
1) Generalized additive model: GAM_final.R.  
2) Empirical dynamic modeling: EDM_final.R is used to produce the results, and EDM_final_plot.R is used to plot the results.
